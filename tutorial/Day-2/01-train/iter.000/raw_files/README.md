The initial set of data was generated by randomly dispacing all atomic 
positions in x, y and z directions by a maximum amplitude of 0.1 A. 
You can find the code we used to generate the initial set of configurations 
at ./generate_initial_coordinates/randomize.py 

Number of initial configurations = 400

We labeled each of these configurations with PBE energy and forces.

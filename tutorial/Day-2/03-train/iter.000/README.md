This folder contains the raw files and DP input scripts used to generate 
the very first DP potential (before entering the iterative training).

Check the README.md file in folder ./raw_data for more details on how 
the initial set of data was generated.

3 different potentials were trained. Each of them can be found in folders
1, 2 and 3.

# Molecular Simulation with Machine Learning
## On-line workshop, July 13-14, 2020

Welcome to the repository of the workshop! Here you will find the instructions for the tutorials and other useful material.
For now the tutorial is consist of two parts, and be given in two days.

1. [The first part](./tutorial/Day-1) gives an introduction of DP-GEN, a systematic way to generate a Deep Potential model.
2. [The second part](./tutorial/Day-2) is an example of using Deep Potential to do enhanced sampling calculation and improve the model at the same time.

You can check corresponding folders for more detailed instructions.
